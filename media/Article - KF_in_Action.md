# Knowledge Fabric in Action: How an AI System Learns, Accumulates, and Applies Generalized Knowledge

*Note: What follows describes a specialized instantiation of Knowledge Fabric (KF) applied to solving ARC-AGI puzzles — a benchmark designed to test abstract reasoning and generalization in AI systems at a level that has historically required human-like intelligence. The core KF principles are fully in place here. We intend to apply the same architecture to other domains in the near future.*

## Context: How AI Systems Retain Knowledge Today

Before describing what Knowledge Fabric does, it is worth situating it against the current landscape. Most AI systems handle knowledge retention in one of the following ways:

| Approach | How knowledge is "retained" |
|---|---|
| RAG | Retrieves documents — abstraction is limited to chunk selection, not rule extraction |
| Fine-tuning | Updates weights — knowledge is implicit in parameters, not inspectable or provenance-tracked |
| Memory systems (MemGPT, etc.) | Stores facts and conversation summaries — generalization across tasks is not the design goal |
| Tool use (function calling) | Operates on pre-defined tools — dynamic tool generation from task evidence is not standard practice |
| o1/o3 reasoning | Deep per-task reasoning — accumulated cross-task knowledge is not part of the architecture |

None of these approaches is wrong for its intended purpose. The point is that none of them is designed to do what Knowledge Fabric does: extract abstract, generalizable rules from task experience, generate and verify executable tools, and accumulate both in a local, auditable knowledge base that compounds in value over time.

## The Core Mechanism

Knowledge Fabric's engine is a **multi-agent inference loop** that separates concerns across three specialized roles, each with a distinct cognitive function.

### The Agents

**SOLVER** is the hypothesis engine. Given a task — a set of input/output training pairs — SOLVER reasons simultaneously across three dimensions: spatial structure, procedural transformation, and analogical pattern. It produces a single, falsifiable hypothesis: a precise description of the rule governing the transformation.

**MEDIATOR** is the verifier and orchestrator. It takes SOLVER's hypothesis and rigorously tests it against every training pair. If the hypothesis holds, MEDIATOR translates it into deterministic pseudo-code — a structured execution plan. Critically, if the plan requires a capability that doesn't yet exist, MEDIATOR issues a **tool generation request**, specifying the tool's behavior with concrete examples drawn from the training pairs themselves.

**EXECUTOR** runs the pseudo-code against the test input deterministically. It operates on a registered tool registry — a growing library of verified, reusable Python functions. No LLM inference happens at execution time. The answer is either correct or it isn't.

Before any of this runs, a **Round 0 rule match** scans the accumulated rule registry against the current task. If a prior rule matches the pattern, the system can bypass hypothesis generation entirely — a direct expression of compounding knowledge.

### Failure: The Self-Correction Loop

When EXECUTOR produces a wrong answer, the system does not simply retry. MEDIATOR receives the failed output, diagnoses the gap between the hypothesis and the actual transformation, and issues a **revised pseudo-code plan** — up to five revision cycles. Each revision is a targeted correction, not a random retry. If a tool was wrong, MEDIATOR can request a corrected tool, which enters its own **verification sub-loop**: the generated code is tested against all training pairs, with up to three self-correction attempts before registration. Tools that cannot pass verification are rejected and never enter the registry.

### Success: Generalizing Knowledge

When a task is solved, the learning does not stop. MEDIATOR extracts the governing rule and writes it to a **persistent rule registry**. Rules are expressed in **plain natural language** — structured, categorized, and immediately readable by a human. Tools are stored as **verified Python functions**. This distinction is deliberate: natural language rules are easy to inspect, audit, and generalize; Python tools provide the deterministic precision that LLMs cannot.

Rules are not written as solutions to specific tasks — they describe a *class* of patterns, applicable to future tasks that share the same underlying structure even if surface details differ. New rules enter at `candidate` status and are promoted to `active` only after firing successfully on a task different from the one that created them. Every rule carries full **lineage** — whether it was created fresh, generalized, specialized, merged, or consolidated from prior rules — making the knowledge base auditable and traceable over time.

The registry actively maintains its own quality. An **auto-deprecation mechanism** monitors rule performance: any rule that fires repeatedly but never contributes to a correct solution is automatically retired. The knowledge base stays lean and accurate over time.

> **A note on data ownership**: the rules and tools accumulated by this process are stored entirely on the user's local machine. No knowledge is sent to an external service or shared across users. This design is intentional — it enables user ownership, clear provenance of how each piece of knowledge was derived, and governance over what the system knows and applies. In regulated industries this is not a convenience; it is a requirement.

## What a Rule Looks Like

Rules are stored as structured natural language entries. Here is a real rule extracted after solving an ARC-AGI puzzle involving gravity-like object sorting:

```
Condition: [gravity] Grid contains multiple disconnected objects classifiable as either
           (a) closed hollow rectangles (complete rectangular perimeter with all interior
           cells background, bounding box at least 3×3) or
           (b) open/cross shapes (plus, T, L, asymmetric cross, incomplete frame,
           or any non-rectangular outline)

Action: Move all CLOSED HOLLOW RECTANGLES to TOP of grid stacking from row 0 downward;
        move all OPEN/CROSS shapes to BOTTOM stacking from last row upward. Each object
        slides as a rigid unit preserving its exact column span and its original color.
        Different-type objects pass through each other freely; same-type objects maintain
        original relative vertical order. Use gravity_by_type tool.
        Classification is purely structural/geometric, not color-based.

Lineage: consolidated (merged from 8 near-duplicate rules describing the same pattern)
Status: active | Fired: 6 | Succeeded: 2 | Failed: 4
```

An AI practitioner will notice several things here: the rule is not a specific puzzle solution — it describes a *class* of spatial sorting problems. The lineage shows the system evolved this rule by consolidating eight narrower rules that had accumulated across multiple puzzles. The success/failure stats show the rule is imperfect and will be auto-deprecated if it continues to underperform — the knowledge base is self-correcting.

## What a Tool Looks Like

Tools are Python functions generated by the system, verified against training pairs, and registered for deterministic reuse. Here is `fill_enclosed` — generated to handle a class of puzzles requiring enclosed-region detection:

```python
def fill_enclosed(grid, **kwargs):
    """Flood-fill from all border background cells;
    any background cell not reachable becomes fill_color."""
    from collections import deque
    background = kwargs.get('background', 0)
    fill_color  = kwargs.get('fill_color', 4)
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    result   = [row[:] for row in grid]
    visited  = [[False] * W for _ in range(H)]
    queue    = deque()
    # Seed BFS from every background cell on the border
    for r in range(H):
        for c in range(W):
            if (r == 0 or r == H-1 or c == 0 or c == W-1) and grid[r][c] == background:
                visited[r][c] = True
                queue.append((r, c))
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
            nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
            if 0<=nr<H and 0<=nc<W and not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc]==background:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    # Any background cell not reached from the border is enclosed
    for r in range(H):
        for c in range(W):
            if grid[r][c] == background and not visited[r][c]:
                result[r][c] = fill_color
    return result
```

This tool was generated autonomously — the system wrote it, tested it against every training pair, and registered it only after it produced exact pixel-perfect matches. Once registered, it is available to any future task that involves enclosed regions, at zero additional LLM cost.

### Why Tools Matter Beyond Convenience

The creation of tools is not a workflow optimization — it addresses a fundamental limitation of LLMs. Language models are poor at tasks requiring **repetitive precision**: counting cells, tracking coordinates across a large grid, applying the same geometric operation consistently to dozens of objects. A single off-by-one error in a 30×30 grid produces a wrong answer even when the reasoning was correct.

Deterministic Python tools eliminate this failure mode entirely. Once `fill_enclosed` exists and is verified, it produces the exact same output every time, on any grid, with zero probability of a counting error. This has two direct consequences:

- **Reliability**: tasks that previously failed due to execution errors now pass consistently. The system's accuracy ceiling rises as the tool library grows.
- **Cost**: tool execution has no LLM inference cost. A task solved via Rule 0 match + a registered tool costs a fraction of a task that requires full hypothesis generation. As the registry fills, average cost per task drops measurably.

## Claude Code as Development Manager

This is where Knowledge Fabric diverges most sharply from conventional AI development — and where an honest assessment is warranted.

When the multi-agent loop exhausts its revision budget and fails, Claude Code analyzes the failure, categorizes the gap — whether it lies in the hypothesis strategy, the tool library, the execution logic, or the rule representation — and proposes a targeted system-level change: not a workaround, but a structural improvement to the system itself. It then reruns the system with no hints and no task-specific shortcuts to confirm the fix produces a correct solution autonomously.

A critical discipline governs this process: **gap repair must never become answer injection**. Injecting the answer (pre-seeding the correct rule, providing the hypothesis directly) produces a one-time fix that the system cannot transfer to future tasks. Repairing the gap — improving the reasoning prompt, adding a verified built-in tool, correcting the rule matching logic — permanently expands what the system can discover on its own.

When Claude Code cannot close the gap, it surfaces a precise question to the human: not "what is the answer?" but "what is the missing insight?" The human responds with a minimal hint — sometimes a single sentence. Claude Code then translates that hint into a concrete system upgrade and reruns the task end-to-end to verify it.

### Is This a Unique Way to Do AI?

Honestly: **the individual components are not new. The discipline and the specific recursive structure are.**

Every senior software engineer diagnoses failures, proposes fixes, and validates them. What Claude Code does in this system is structurally the same — it is just that the "engineer" is itself an LLM operating on an LLM-powered system. The recursion is interesting but not without precedent; self-improving AI systems have been explored in various forms.

What is **genuinely notable** here is threefold:

1. **The gap repair discipline is formalized and enforced**, not left to developer judgment. The distinction between gap repair and answer injection is precise, documented, and treated as a correctness criterion. Most development teams, human or AI-assisted, do not apply this discipline rigorously. They patch the immediate failure. The result is a system that accumulates workarounds rather than capabilities.

2. **The human's role is explicitly minimized and bounded**. The system is designed so that Claude Code exhausts its own diagnostic capacity before escalating. When escalation happens, the human provides the minimum viable insight — not the solution. This is different from conventional HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) systems where the human is a routine participant. Here the human is an expert consultant called only when the system's own reasoning reaches its limit.

3. **The improvement target is the AI system's generalization capacity, not its task performance**. When Claude Code adds a reasoning step to the solver prompt or adds a built-in tool, it is not solving the current puzzle — it is expanding the class of puzzles the system can solve autonomously in the future. This orientation toward structural generalization rather than local correctness is what distinguishes the process.

The fair claim for the article is this: Claude Code is not just a coding assistant here; it is a principled methodology for continuous structural improvement of an AI system, applied recursively. That is significant, even if none of the individual components are unprecedented.

## Benefits and Application Domains

### Why This Architecture Matters

| Property | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Knowledge artifacts | Rules and tools are created dynamically as the system solves problems, then persisted — each one a reusable asset that reduces the cost and increases the reliability of every future similar task |
| Rules in natural language | Auditable, explainable, editable by domain experts without engineering involvement |
| Tools in verified Python | Exact, deterministic execution; eliminates the precision errors that LLMs are prone to on repetitive or computational tasks |
| Local storage | User owns all accumulated knowledge; full provenance; no vendor dependency |
| Auto-deprecation | Knowledge base stays accurate over time; underperforming rules are retired automatically |
| Rule lineage | Every piece of knowledge traces back to the task and correction event that created it |
| Cost compounding | Each solved task reduces average cost for all future similar tasks |

### Domains That Benefit Most

Knowledge Fabric's architecture delivers the greatest value in domains where:
- Tasks share underlying structural patterns across many instances
- Correct answers are verifiable (there is a ground truth)
- Precision matters — where an off-by-one error or a missed edge case is a wrong answer
- Knowledge ownership and auditability are requirements, not preferences

**Strongest candidates:**

**Medical diagnosis and clinical decision support** — diagnostic rules generalize across patients; tools can compute lab value thresholds, risk scores, and differential rankings with exactness that prose LLM responses cannot guarantee. Provenance of each rule (which cases informed it) is a regulatory requirement.

**Legal reasoning and contract analysis** — legal rules are inherently structured as condition-action pairs; tools can extract clause patterns, compute obligation timelines, and flag conflicts deterministically. Firm-specific rule bases stay local and proprietary.

**Financial analysis and risk assessment** — quantitative rules generalize across assets and time periods; tools eliminate the arithmetic errors that LLMs make on multi-step calculations. Audit trails are mandatory.

**Scientific research and experiment design** — hypotheses about experimental patterns can be formalized as rules; tools can apply statistical tests, normalize data, and detect anomalies with precision. Reproducibility requires deterministic execution.

**Manufacturing and quality control** — inspection rules generalize across product variants; tools apply geometric and statistical checks that require exact computation. Local storage keeps proprietary process knowledge off external servers.

**Software engineering and code review** — code patterns generalize across codebases; tools can run static analysis, compute complexity metrics, and detect anti-patterns deterministically. Rule bases accumulate institutional knowledge that currently lives only in senior engineers' heads.

The common thread: **any domain where expertise can be expressed as generalizable rules, where execution requires precision, and where the knowledge has enough value to be worth owning.**

*The ARC-AGI benchmark was chosen as the initial proving ground precisely because it makes no concessions to memorization: every puzzle requires genuine generalization from a small number of training pairs. If the architecture holds there, the path to higher-stakes domains is a question of prompt adaptation and domain-specific tooling — not fundamental re-engineering.*
