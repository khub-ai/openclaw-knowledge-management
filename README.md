# OpenClaw Knowledge Management

**OpenClaw Knowledge Management** is an extension for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) that gives AI agents the ability to **learn from interaction, persist what they learn, and reuse it reliably** — all as **user-owned, local, portable knowledge artifacts** rather than opaque server-side state.

## Who this is for

**Individual users and knowledge workers** — if you use an AI agent daily and find yourself re-explaining your preferences, correcting the same mistakes, or re-teaching your workflow every session, this is for you. PIL makes the agent accumulate what it learns about you across sessions — your communication style, your conventions, your judgment criteria — stored as files on your own machine that you can inspect, edit, and take with you if you switch platforms.

**Enterprise AI adopters** — deploying AI agents at organizational scale surfaces four problems that no single framing captures:

- **Scalability and cost**: Naive agent memory forces a choice between losing context across sessions or injecting growing conversation histories into every context window — a cost that scales linearly with accumulated history. Structured local artifacts break this: once a preference, convention, or procedure is consolidated, it is applied through an in-memory index lookup at zero LLM cost. The more the system knows, the cheaper each interaction becomes, not the reverse.

- **Knowledge continuity**: When an expert leaves, their judgment — which arguments hold up, which exceptions to flag, which edge cases to handle a particular way — leaves with them. PIL captures that judgment incrementally as active artifacts that a successor's agent inherits from day one, without requiring any explicit documentation effort from the departing employee.

- **Knowledge as an organizational asset**: Structured, versioned, provenance-bearing artifacts are organizational property, not configuration. They survive platform migrations (model-agnostic text, no vendor lock-in), enable coherent M&A knowledge reconciliation at the artifact level, and — as the format matures — can be certified, licensed, or traded as expert knowledge packages.

- **Governance**: Every artifact carries a structured provenance record from creation through retirement — who created it, from which conversation, who approved it for team or org use, when it was revised, and when it was superseded. For regulated industries, this answers the question auditors will eventually ask: *what did the agent know at the time of this recommendation, and who signed off on it?*

**AI ecosystem builders and strategists** — if you are tracking where durable value accumulates in the AI stack, PIL proposes a new asset class: portable, typed, user-owned knowledge artifacts. The artifact format, if it achieves adoption, defines a coordination layer — analogous to what npm did for packages or OpenAPI did for APIs — around which expert knowledge marketplaces, org custody services, and certification businesses can form.

**AI platforms and potential partners** — PIL is built as an OpenClaw extension, but the artifact format is platform-agnostic. A platform that supports PIL artifact import/export gains interoperability with an emerging knowledge ecosystem and a credible story for user data portability and governance.

## Why this exists

Modern AI agents appear to learn from interaction, but the knowledge they accumulate — whether through context windows, compacted session memory, or fine-tuning — remains **server-side, opaque, and platform-locked**. The user cannot easily inspect, edit, govern, or move it. If the user switches platforms, the knowledge disappears.

This project takes a different approach: knowledge is extracted from interaction, stored locally as human-readable text, and owned entirely by the user. The artifacts are **model-agnostic** — any sufficiently capable LLM can consume them. They can be edited with a text editor, version-controlled with git, shared with colleagues, or imported into a different AI assistant.

## What the agent learns

The project is built around **four types of knowledge**, with emphasis on their generalized forms:

| Memory type | What it captures | Generalized into |
|---|---|---|
| **Episodic** | What happened in conversation | Raw material for generalization of other types |
| **Semantic** | Facts, preferences, conventions | General rules applicable across contexts |
| **Procedural** | How to do things | Structured recipes, optionally executable programs |
| **Evaluative** | What counts as "good" | Judgment heuristics and value frameworks |

**Generalization is the key.** We don't just record that the user corrected a summary format five times — we distill it into a rule ("always use bullet points") that the agent applies proactively in new situations. For procedures, a structured recipe can optionally be compiled into a deterministic program for tasks that require perfect repeatability. For evaluative knowledge, patterns of preference become judgment frameworks the agent uses to make good choices in novel situations — the closest analogue to what we colloquially call "wisdom."

## See it in action

A condensed example of how the agent learns progressively over multiple sessions:

> **Session 2** — Agent notices the user always names financial statements as `YYYY-MM-institution-account.pdf`. It proposes a convention. User confirms. → *Semantic artifact created.*
>
> **Session 3** — Agent learns the user downloads from Chase, Fidelity, and Amex monthly. It proposes a checklist procedure. → *Procedural artifact created.*
>
> **Session 4** — After three identical runs, the agent offers to compile the checklist into a script. → *Recipe retained; executable program linked as optional optimised form.*
>
> **Session 5** — User closes an account and opens a new one. Agent revises the institution list, the procedure, and the script together. → *Coherent revision across artifact types.*

→ *[Full example with dialogue](docs/example-learning-in-action.md)*

## Core idea: Persistable Interactive Learning (PIL)

The system treats dialogue as a learning substrate and produces durable knowledge artifacts through an 8-stage pipeline:

1. **Elicit** — surface candidate knowledge from interaction
2. **Induce** — classify into a typed artifact (semantic, procedural, evaluative, etc.)
3. **Validate** — estimate confidence and scope
4. **Compact** — compress into minimal form; deduplicate
5. **Persist** — store locally with provenance and versioning
6. **Retrieve** — recall by relevance and context
7. **Apply** — confidence-gated: suggest, auto-apply, or hold back
8. **Revise** — update or retire when contradicted or outdated

## Design goals

- **Extension for OpenClaw** — additive layer; users install/upgrade OpenClaw normally
- **User-owned and local** — knowledge lives on your machine, not a vendor's server
- **Model-agnostic portability** — artifacts are text; any capable LLM can consume them
- **Confidence-gated reuse** — learned knowledge is *suggested*, *auto-applied*, or *held back* based on certainty
- **Free-form artifacts** — lightweight conventions, not rigid schemas; human-readable and editable
- **Versioned and auditable** — changes are tracked; revisions are first-class

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, pnpm, and an Anthropic API key.

The reference implementation uses [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/) as the LLM backend. Any LLM can be substituted by providing a different `LLMFn` adapter — see [`apps/playground/index.ts`](apps/playground/index.ts) for the adapter pattern.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khub-ai/openclaw-knowledge-management
cd openclaw-knowledge-management
pnpm install

# Set your Anthropic API key (obtain from https://console.anthropic.com/)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # macOS / Linux / WSL
# $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."     # Windows PowerShell

pnpm start        # runs all 8 PIL stages against sample input
pnpm dev          # re-runs on file changes (watch mode)
pnpm test         # runs the full test suite (no API key required)
```

Artifacts are stored at `~/.openclaw/knowledge/artifacts.jsonl`.
Override with `KNOWLEDGE_STORE_PATH=/your/path pnpm start`.

## Implementation status

Milestones 1a–1d are implemented. The LLM-backed pipeline is functional and tested.

### What's implemented (Milestones 1a–1d)

| Component | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact schema** | `src/types.ts` | Full schema: kind, certainty, scope, stage, tags, evidence, relations, salience, lifecycle fields |
| **LLM extraction** | `src/extract.ts` | `extractFromMessage()` — language-agnostic, single LLM call per message |
| **Evidence consolidation** | `src/extract.ts` | `consolidateEvidence()` — distills N observations into a generalized rule |
| **Pipeline orchestration** | `src/pipeline.ts` | `processMessage()` — extract → match → accumulate → inject decision |
| **Three-stage model** | `src/store.ts` | candidate → accumulating → consolidated; auto-promotes at threshold (default: 3) |
| **Tag-based retrieval** | `src/store.ts` | `retrieve()` — tag overlap scoring (Tier 1) + content fallback |
| **Inject label logic** | `src/store.ts` | `[established]` / `[suggestion]` / `[provisional]` gating |
| **Feedback tracking** | `src/store.ts` | `recordAccepted()` / `recordRejected()` — nudge confidence from user signals |
| **Plugin wiring** | `index.ts` / `tools.ts` | `knowledge_search` tool registered with OpenClaw; hook stubs ready |
| **Computer-assistant demo** | `apps/computer-assistant/` | REPL, Anthropic LLM adapter, OS actions, PIL-aware agent |
| **Test suite** | `apps/computer-assistant/src/tests/` | 74 tests covering extraction, store, pipeline, and scenarios |
| **Benchmark suite** | `apps/computer-assistant/benchmarks/` | Extraction precision/recall/F1; retrieval hit rate; 18+ scenarios |

### What's next (Phase 2 onward)

- OpenClaw hook wiring for fully passive per-message elicitation (no explicit instruction needed)
- True Tier-2 triggering: cheap LLM disambiguation of partial tag matches
- Decay: effective confidence decreases for unretrieved, unreinforced artifacts
- Semantic/vector retrieval (Phase 2+)
- Evaluative knowledge generalization (judgment heuristics, value frameworks)
- Procedural recipe compilation to executable programs (Phase 3)
- Import/export and cross-platform portability (Phase 4)
- CLI for inspecting, editing, and deleting artifacts

## Non-goals

- Not fine-tuning base LLM weights
- Not replacing OpenClaw's core — this is an extension
- Not treating "memory" as a single bucket — knowledge types differ and require different controls
- Not prescribing a rigid schema — artifacts are free-form text with conventions

## Status

Milestones 1a–1d implemented. The LLM-backed pipeline is functional: knowledge is extracted from user messages, accumulated across interactions, consolidated into generalized rules, and injected into future prompts. A working computer-assistant demo shows PIL learning user-specific patterns (aliases, file-handling preferences, procedures) across sessions. 74 tests pass with no API key required; a benchmark suite measures extraction precision/recall and retrieval hit rate against a curated scenario set.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially around:
- Knowledge artifact conventions and evaluation
- Retrieval and ranking methods for learned artifacts
- Evaluative knowledge representation
- Procedural knowledge and code synthesis
- Safe application policies and conflict resolution
- Tooling for inspection, export, and deletion

**Working thesis:** Agents become genuinely useful when they can **learn interactively**, **persist what they learn as user-owned artifacts**, and **reliably reuse that knowledge** — all without repeatedly re-prompting the user, retraining the model, or locking knowledge into a vendor's platform.
