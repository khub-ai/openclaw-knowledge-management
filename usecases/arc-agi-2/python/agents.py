Write a single Python function that implements the requested grid transformation.

Requirements:
- Signature: def {name}(grid, **kwargs) -> list
  where `grid` is list[list[int]] (0 = background color)
- Return a NEW 2D list of ints — never modify the input in-place
- Must be deterministic and handle edge cases (empty grid, single cell) gracefully
- No docstring, no imports at module level — just the function body
- CRITICAL: NEVER hardcode color values (like 6, 8, 3) or grid positions you observed in a specific example. Colors and key positions vary per input — always compute them dynamically from the grid.
- CRITICAL: When the behavior mentions blocks separated by a separator value: find separator row/col POSITIONS first by scanning (e.g., rows where all values == separator), then compute band_starts as the rows/cols between separators. Do NOT assume uniform spacing like br*block_size — separators create irregular offsets (e.g., seps at rows 3,7,11,15,19 → band_starts=[0,4,8,12,16,20], NOT [0,3,6,9,12,15]).

Available in scope (no need to import):
- `np` / `numpy`: NumPy
- `to_np(grid)` → numpy 2D int array;  `to_list(arr)` → list[list[int]]
- `flood_fill(grid, start_row, start_col, fill_color)` → new grid
- `replace_color(grid, from_color, to_color)` → new grid
- `unique_colors(grid)` → set of ints present in grid
- `color_count(grid, color)` → int count of cells with that color
- `bounding_box(grid, color)` → (r_min, c_min, r_max, c_max) or None
- `count_connected_components(grid, color)` → int
- `grids_equal(a, b)` → bool

Return ONLY the function code inside a ```python block. No explanation outside the block."""
