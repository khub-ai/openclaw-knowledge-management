knowledge_bootstrap.py — Guided-tour rule bootstrapper.

PHILOSOPHY
----------
Peeking at env._game is permitted during early development, but peeking alone
is not enough: internal coordinates and sprite tags are not observable through
the standard API, so any rule that references them directly would be useless in
competition mode.

This script bridges the gap:

  1. PEEK  — use env._game + level_meta_from_game() to learn WHERE the key
             positions (targets, changers, resets) are in game coordinates.

  2. TOUR  — execute the BFS-optimal plan step by step, observe the rendered
             64x64 frame at each step with the object tracker, and record
             WHAT VISUALLY HAPPENS when the player visits each key position:
               - what color appears at that cell in the frame
               - how detected objects change (size, orientation, centroid)
               - whether obs.levels_completed increments

  3. WRITE — emit rules expressed entirely in observable terms (pixel
             positions, colors, object attribute changes, event signals).
             Tag them source="bootstrap" so provenance is visible.

The bootstrapped rules can be used immediately by the ensemble.  As the
ensemble accumulates independent observations it can confirm (promote) or
refute (deprecate) each rule without ever looking at env._game.

Usage
-----
    python knowledge_bootstrap.py --env ls20 [--levels 1 2 3] [--dry-run]

The script will:
  - Reset the environment and step through each requested level.
  - After observing each level, write bootstrapped rules to rules.json.
  - Print a summary of what was learned.
