ensemble.py — ARC-AGI-3 episode orchestrator.

One episode = one attempt to complete an ARC-AGI-3 environment (e.g. LS20).

Architecture (per OBSERVER-MEDIATOR cycle within an episode):
  Round 0  — Rule matching: which patterns apply to the current state?
  Round 1  — OBSERVER: analyze current frame -> structured observation
  Round 2  — MEDIATOR: observation + rules + goals -> action plan + goal updates
  Round 3  — Execute: call env.step() for each planned action; stop if a level
             advances or WIN/GAME_OVER is detected; loop back to Round 1.

Post-episode: fire rule success/failure based on levels completed.
