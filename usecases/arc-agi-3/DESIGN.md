# ARC-AGI-3 Ensemble — Design Decisions

> Status: working document, not for publication yet.
> Private companion: `.private/DESIGN_PRIVATE.md` (gitignored) — LLM architecture, air-gap strategy.

## Overview

The ARC-AGI-3 ensemble is a specialization of the Knowledge Fabric (KF) pipeline for
interactive game environments. Unlike ARC-AGI-2 (static input→output puzzles), ARC-AGI-3
tasks are sequential decision problems: the agent must explore an unknown game, learn its
mechanics, and navigate to a win condition purely through action and observation.

**Entry point:** `usecases/arc-agi-3/python/harness.py`
**Python runtime:** Windows Store Python 3.12 (arc_agi SDK installed there, not conda)
**Default run:** `python harness.py --env ls20 --episodes 1 --max-steps 10`

## Episode structure

```
env.reset()
inject_initial_goals()        # "win game", "complete level 1", "understand mechanics"

while steps < max_steps and cycles < max_cycles and state != WIN/GAME_OVER:

    Round 0: Rule matching
        RuleEngine retrieves candidate+active rules matching current state

    Round 1: OBSERVER
        Input:  frame (64×64 grid), current objects, concept_bindings, trend predictions,
                action effects table, action history, matched rules
        Output: JSON with level_description, visual_observations, action_characterizations,
                identified_objects, concept_bindings, hypothesized_goal, reasoning
                All inferences labeled [GUESS] or [CONFIRMED]

    Round 2: MEDIATOR
        Input:  OBSERVER analysis, rules, goals+state, action history
        Output: JSON with action_plan, rule_updates, goal_updates, state_updates, reasoning

    Parse updates:
        - Merge concept_bindings from OBSERVER into state
        - Apply goal_updates and state_updates from MEDIATOR
        - Add rule_updates (all forced to "candidate" status)

    Round 3: ACTOR — for each action in plan:
        env.step(action)
        accumulate_action_effect()   pixel-level + object-level diffs with raw before/after
        detect_wall_contacts()       if piece didn't move but normally does → wall colors
        compute_trend_predictions()  → push urgency goals if [URGENT]
        write_step_log()             JSON playlog file
        log to episode_NN.log

    if level advance:
        update_level_goals()
        promote_fired_candidate_rules()
        break to re-observe

Post-episode:
    Record rule success/failure based on won/not
    auto_deprecate(min_candidate_fired=5)
    Write episode summary to log
```

## Design decisions

### D1 — Rule lifecycle differs from ARC-AGI-2

All ARC-AGI-3 rules start as `candidate`, never `active`, regardless of `add_rule()` defaults.
After `parse_mediator_rule_updates()`, any rule with `lineage.type == "new"` is immediately
forced to `"candidate"` before saving.

**Why:** ARC-AGI-2 rules are verified by an executor against demos — passing all demos
justifies `active`. ARC-AGI-3 rules are exploration hypotheses — they need independent
confirmation across multiple episodes before being trusted.

**Promotion:** Candidate → active only when a level advances during a cycle where the rule fired.

**Auto-deprecation threshold:** `min_candidate_fired=5` (vs default 1 for ARC-AGI-2).
The `min_candidate_fired` parameter was added to `core/knowledge/rules.py` for this.

---

### D2 — Extended colors are not pre-labeled

Colors 0–9 are standard ARC-AGI palette. Colors 10+ are game-specific extensions.
They are rendered as distinct lowercase letters (`j`=10, `k`=11, `x`=12, ...) so the LLM
can see them clearly, but no semantic meaning is hardcoded.

**Why:** Hardcoding "color12 = cursor" breaks the moment a different game uses color12
for something else, or the same game changes. Roles must be discovered through exploration
and stored in concept_bindings.

**What is allowed:** Rendering distinction (different char per color value). Not allowed:
pre-assigning semantic names to specific color integers in any prompt or constant.

---

### D3 — Concept bindings schema (two-level, game-local)

`state_manager._data["concept_bindings"]` uses two schemas:

1. `{color_int: role_name}` — color-keyed, proposed by OBSERVER per episode
   Example: `{12: "player_piece", 11: "step_counter"}`

2. `{"wall_colors": [c, ...]}` — concept-keyed list, populated by wall detection
   Example: `{"wall_colors": [4, 5]}`

**Critical invariant:** ALL concept_bindings are game-local and episode-local.
StateManager is created fresh each episode — nothing persists across episodes by design.
The same color may mean different things in different games.

**Why two schemas:** The wall concept travels across games (the concept "wall" is stable)
but the color instantiation does not. Storing it as `{"wall_colors": [...]}` separates the
concept name from the color, whereas `{4: "wall"}` would conflate them.

**Role name vocabulary:** OBSERVER must use generic names: `player_piece`, `step_counter`,
`goal_region`, `reference_pattern`, `wall`. Not game-specific names.

---

### D4 — Attribute change records store raw numeric before/after

Each `attribute_changes` entry in `object_observations` includes:
```python
{
  "color": int,
  "changed": ["size", "width"],      # which attributes changed
  "summary": "azure: size 12->18",   # human-readable
  "before": {"size": 12, "width": 4},  # raw numbers ← key addition
  "after":  {"size": 18, "width": 6},
}
```

**Why:** `compute_trend_predictions` must work from pure data, not string parsing.
Storing raw numbers means any future attribute added to `ObjectRecord` is automatically
eligible for trend analysis with no changes to the prediction code.

---

### D5 — Trend prediction is fully data-driven

`compute_trend_predictions(action_effects, steps_remaining)` iterates over every
`(color, attribute)` pair in the accumulated data. No hardcoded colors, no hardcoded
attribute names. Works for size, width, height, and any future attribute.

Two trend classes detected:
1. **Attribute trend:** consistent increase or decrease → predicts depletion or unbounded growth
2. **Position drift:** consistent directional movement → predicts boundary collision

Direction reversals (oscillation) are excluded — only monotonic drift triggers.
`[URGENT]` is added when predicted depletion is within `steps_remaining`.

**Urgency goal push:** When any prediction is `[URGENT]`, an urgency goal is automatically
pushed to GoalManager (priority 1, deduplicated by description prefix).

---

### D6 — Wall detection is zero-cost and color-agnostic

When a step produces no movement on an object that has moved before under the same action:
1. `infer_typical_direction()` retrieves the most common move direction for this action
2. `detect_wall_contacts()` scans cells immediately beyond the object's bounding box in
   that direction and counts colors found there
3. Those colors are added to `concept_bindings["wall_colors"]` (game-local)

**Why color-agnostic:** Wall color varies between games. The concept "wall" is stable;
the color is not. We discover it per-game rather than assuming any color is always a wall.

---

### D7 — Episode logger captures all reasoning explicitly

`EpisodeLogger` writes `playlogs/episode_NN.log` incrementally. Every significant event
is captured: cycle starts, matched rules, OBSERVER output (guesses labeled), MEDIATOR
reasoning and plan, rule proposals (condition + then), goal events, state key-value changes,
per-step action outcomes with object diffs, wall contacts, concept binding updates, urgency
goals, auto-deprecation events, episode summary.

**Key convention:** OBSERVER labels all inferences as `[GUESS]` or `[CONFIRMED]`.
`[CONFIRMED]` = directly supported by action effects table or prior rules.
`[GUESS]` = inferred from visual structure alone.
This makes the trace auditable — a developer can quickly identify what the system measured
vs. what it assumed.

---

### D8 — Object tracker design principles

**`detect_objects`:** BFS connected-component per color. Objects ≥25% of total cells
are `is_background=True`. `ObjectRecord` has: color, size, centroid, bbox, width, height,
orientation (horizontal/vertical/square), aspect_ratio.

**`diff_objects`:** Same-color greedy nearest-neighbour, match_radius=10. Produces ObjectDiff
with moved, appeared, disappeared, stationary, attribute_changes. Attribute changes tracked
for: size, width, height, orientation.

**Future extension point:** `match_cross_color=False` parameter for color-changing objects —
deferred until evidence of this in any game.

## LS20 game mechanics (discovered empirically, not assumed)

| Element | Color | Value | Behavior |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| Cursor | `x` | 12 | Moves with ACTION1/2/3/4. Starts at centroid ~(46,36). 5w×2h. |
| White component | `W` | 9 | Moves with cursor as a unit — same logical object. 5w×3h. |
| Step counter | `k` | 11 | Shrinks 2 cells per action (any direction). Starts at 84. Turns green. |
| Play field | `G` | 3 | Large green background. Static unless piece moves through it. |
| Outer area | `Y` | 4 | Yellow. Blocks upward cursor movement. Wall candidate. |
| Borders | `b` | 5 | Grey. Also blocks upward movement. Wall candidate. |

**Action map:**
- ACTION1: cursor up 5 rows
- ACTION2: cursor down 5 rows
- ACTION3: cursor left 5 cols (produces diff=2 when at left wall — piece doesn't move)
- ACTION4: cursor right 5 cols

**Win condition:** Unknown. No level advance observed yet. Hypotheses: navigate cursor
to specific position, align with white W reference pattern in bordered box.

**Step budget:** Starting at 84 cells, losing 2/step → 42 actions before step counter
depletes. What happens at depletion is unknown (likely GAME_OVER).
