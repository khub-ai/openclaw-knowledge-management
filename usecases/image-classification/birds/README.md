## The One-Line Summary

An AI model confused Bronzed Cowbirds with Shiny Cowbirds. An ornithologist explained, in plain language, the field marks that distinguish them. The system turned those explanations into explicit rules, tested them against known images, and applied them. When failures persisted, the pupil's confusion was fed back to the tutor for a second round. Accuracy improved from 33% to 83% without retraining the model.

## 1. Why Birds

Fine-grained visual classification of bird species is an ideal proving ground for the Knowledge Fabric thesis — that a domain expert's natural-language explanations can improve AI accuracy on hard cases without retraining.

**The gap is large and measurable.** CLIP zero-shot performance on CUB-200 is around 65%. The supervised state of the art (HERBS, 2023) reaches 93%. That 28-percentage-point gap represents exactly the space where expert discriminative knowledge matters — and where KF aims to operate.

**The hard cases are well-defined.** The remaining errors at SOTA are concentrated in confusable species pairs — cases where two species are so visually similar that statistical training on aggregate visual features falls short. These are exactly the cases where expert verbal criteria ("the bill is shorter relative to head size in a Downy") matter most.

**Expert language is publicly available.** Field guides (Sibley, Kaufman), eBird species accounts, and ornithological literature contain precisely the discriminative reasoning KF needs — for every species and every confusable pair.

**The logic is transparent.** "This is a Bronzed Cowbird and not a Shiny Cowbird because the iris is bright red, not dark brown" is a sentence any naturalist can read, understand, and verify. The knowledge is explicit and auditable.

The pair tested in this experiment:

| Bronzed Cowbird | Shiny Cowbird |
|---|---|
| ![Bronzed Cowbird](../assets/birds/bronzed_cowbird.jpg) | ![Shiny Cowbird](../assets/birds/shiny_cowbird.jpg) |

*Both are all-black cowbirds found in overlapping ranges. Bronzed has a conspicuous red iris, a thick decurved bill, and a prominent neck ruff (visible as raised hackle feathers). Shiny has a dark eye, a slimmer straight bill, and uniformly intense blue-violet iridescent gloss. These differences are visible in photographs but require knowing what to look for.*

## 2. The Dataset

**CUB-200-2011** (Caltech-UCSD Birds)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Images | 11,788 (5,994 train / 5,794 test) |
| Classes | 200 North American bird species |
| Annotations | Labels + 312 binary visual attribute annotations + 10 per-image natural language descriptions (Reed et al.) |
| Access | Fully open — [Caltech download](https://data.caltech.edu/records/65de6-vp158) |
| Leaderboard | [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/fine-grained-image-classification-on-cub-200) |
| CLIP zero-shot | ~65% |
| Supervised SOTA | 93.1% (HERBS, 2023) |

The 312 binary attribute annotations are the closest analogue in ornithology to the lesion-attribute annotations in dermatology: structured visual criteria, defined per species, that capture exactly the kind of discriminative field knowledge KF is designed to work with.

---

## 3. The Approach

This experiment demonstrates [Dialogic Learning](../../../docs/glossary.md#dialogic-learning) applied to a bird identification AI.

The core idea: a cheap, capable-but-fallible vision model (the "pupil") makes errors on hard confusable pairs. An expert — which may be a human ornithologist or a superior AI acting in that role — examines each error and explains *in plain language* what the pupil missed and what field mark should have been decisive. The system turns that explanation into an explicit, testable rule. Before the rule is trusted, it is validated against a pool of labeled images. If it passes, it is registered and applied to the pupil — and the pupil is re-tested.

This is not fine-tuning. The base model's weights are never changed. The knowledge lives in an explicit, human-readable rule file that can be inspected, corrected, or withdrawn at any time.

**Setup for this experiment**:

- **Pupil model**: Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct (via OpenRouter) — a strong open-source vision-language model
- **Expert model**: Claude Sonnet 4.6, acting as a senior ornithologist
- **Validator model**: Claude Sonnet 4.6, independently checking rule quality
- **Pair tested**: Bronzed Cowbird vs Shiny Cowbird (6 images, 3 per class)
- **Held-out validation pool**: 8 images (4 per class, drawn from training split)

**Zero-shot baseline result: 2/6 correct (33.3%)**

Qwen misclassified every Bronzed Cowbird as a Shiny Cowbird, and one Shiny Cowbird as a Bronzed Cowbird. The pattern is exactly the kind of systematic failure the dialogic patching loop is designed to resolve: not random noise, but a consistent gap in what the model knows how to look for.

---

## 4. The Dialogic Patching Loop — Step by Step

The loop runs automatically once a failure case is identified. The expert's involvement is focused on high-value judgment calls; the mechanical work of validating rules against image pools is handled by the system automatically.

## 5. The Expert's Role

In this experiment, the expert role is played by an AI assistant (Claude Sonnet 4.6) instructed to act as a senior ornithologist. In production use, this role would be filled by a human expert. The interactive loop is identical — only the identity of the expert changes.

The expert performs four distinct tasks:

### Role 1 — Rule Author

The expert sees the image and Qwen's wrong prediction. The expert's job is to:
1. Identify exactly what Qwen got wrong — did it miss a field mark? Did it misinterpret one?
2. Author a corrective rule: "When [these specific visual features are present], identify as [species]."

The rule must be purely visual — no range, habitat, vocalizations, or behavior unless directly visible in the image. It must be specific enough not to fire on the confusable species, and generalizable to other images of the same species, not just this one photograph.

### Role 2 — Rule Completer

A separate pass reviews the rule for implicit assumptions. Expert ornithologists write *diagnostic* rules: they describe what is distinctive about the failure case. But they unconsciously omit background conditions that go without saying to a trained observer. A naive AI checking only the explicit list would fire the rule on cases the expert never intended. The RULE_COMPLETER adds those background conditions explicitly — for instance, that the bird is an adult male (eliminating females and juveniles where the field mark may not apply).

### Role 3 — Semantic Validator

Before testing the rule on any images, each precondition is rated:
- **Reliable** — a consistently present, genuinely discriminating feature between the two species
- **Context-dependent** — only meaningful in combination with other conditions
- **Unreliable** — appears in both species or varies too much to be trusted

This step catches weak conditions before they waste validation budget.

### Role 4 — Spectrum Generator

If the completed rule fails the precision gate (too many false positive fires on the wrong species), the system generates four versions of the rule at different levels of specificity — from the single most essential condition to the full completed rule plus an additional tightening condition. All four are tested; the tightest version that still passes is kept. This prevents the common failure mode of over-tightening a rule until it no longer fires on the target image at all.

## 6. Worked Example: Confused Cowbirds

**Zero-shot baseline** — Qwen3-VL-8B on 6 images, no rules active:

| Image | Ground Truth | Prediction | Correct |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bronzed_Cowbird_0019 | Bronzed Cowbird | Shiny Cowbird | WRONG |
| Bronzed_Cowbird_0061 | Bronzed Cowbird | Shiny Cowbird | WRONG |
| Bronzed_Cowbird_0081 | Bronzed Cowbird | Shiny Cowbird | WRONG |
| Shiny_Cowbird_0005  | Shiny Cowbird  | Shiny Cowbird | correct |
| Shiny_Cowbird_0030  | Shiny Cowbird  | Shiny Cowbird | correct |
| Shiny_Cowbird_0080  | Shiny Cowbird  | Bronzed Cowbird | WRONG |

Qwen defaulted to Shiny Cowbird for every all-dark cowbird it saw. It identified the all-dark plumage — a feature shared by both species — and stopped there, without checking the features that actually distinguish them.

The patching loop processed each of the 4 failures in turn across two rounds.

---

### Case 1 — Bronzed_Cowbird_0019

![Bronzed_Cowbird_0019](../assets/birds/bronzed_0019_fixed.jpg)

**Ground truth**: Bronzed Cowbird
**Qwen's prediction**: Shiny Cowbird — WRONG

**What Qwen missed**: The bright red iris. Bronzed Cowbird has a strikingly red eye visible in photographs; Shiny Cowbird has a dark brown-to-blackish iris that never appears red. The bill shape is also diagnostic — Bronzed has a thick, decurved bill that appears almost finch-like, while Shiny has a slender, straight-culmen blackbird bill. Qwen fixated on the all-black plumage (shared by both species) and defaulted to Shiny Cowbird without checking either the eye color or the bill morphology.

**Expert's corrective rule**:

> *When a small, all-black cowbird shows a conspicuous bright red or orange-red iris clearly visible as a bold colored eye, combined with a distinctly thick-based, slightly decurved bill that appears heavier and more robust than a typical icterid bill — identify as Bronzed Cowbird.*

**Validation result**:

| Pool | Fires on trigger | True Positives | False Positives | Precision | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Held-out (8 images) | Yes | 1 | 0 | **1.00** | Pass |

Rule registered as **r_001**. Re-run: **FIXED**.

---

### Case 2 — Bronzed_Cowbird_0061

![Bronzed_Cowbird_0061](../assets/birds/bronzed_0061_fixed.jpg)

**Ground truth**: Bronzed Cowbird
**Qwen's prediction**: Shiny Cowbird — WRONG

**What Qwen missed**: Again the red iris — the single most diagnostic field mark separating these two species — and the heavy neck ruff (hackle feathers that create the bull-necked profile characteristic of Bronzed Cowbird, entirely absent in Shiny Cowbird).

**Expert's corrective rule** (authored independently for this image):

> *When a black cowbird shows a distinctly red or orange-red iris visible at normal photographic distance, combined with a noticeably thick-based, heavy bill (deeper culmen depth than a typical icterid) — identify as Bronzed Cowbird.*

**Validation result**: Rule passed the held-out gate at full precision.

| Pool | Fires on trigger | True Positives | False Positives | Precision | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Held-out (8 images) | Yes | 4 | 0 | **1.00** | Pass |

Rule registered as **r_002**. Re-run: **FIXED**.

---

### Case 3 — Bronzed_Cowbird_0081

![Bronzed_Cowbird_0081](../assets/birds/bronzed_0081_unfixed.jpg)

**Ground truth**: Bronzed Cowbird
**Qwen's prediction**: Shiny Cowbird — WRONG

**What Qwen missed**: In this image the red iris is less clearly visible (angle or lighting), so the expert focused on structural features: the heavy, deep-based bill and the proportionally large, rounded head — the "bull-necked" gestalt that distinguishes Bronzed Cowbird from the slimmer-headed, slimmer-billed Shiny Cowbird.

**Expert's corrective rule (Round 1)**:

> *When a uniformly dark/black cowbird shows a visibly thick, deep-based, and conical bill that appears noticeably bulbous or heavy at the base (giving a 'bull-headed' profile), combined with a puffy or ruffed neck/nape that creates a rounded, large-headed silhouette — identify as Bronzed Cowbird.*

**Spectrum search**: The completion pass over-tightened the rule (10 preconditions, fails to fire). The pre-completion rule (5 preconditions) fired with precision=1.00, and was selected:

| Level | Preconditions | TP | FP | Precision | Fires on trigger | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-completion (L0) | 5 | 4 | 0 | **1.00** | Yes | **Pass** |
| Most general (L1) | 1 | 4 | 1 | 0.80 | Yes | Pass |
| Moderate (L2) | 2 | 4 | 2 | 0.67 | Yes | Fail |
| Most specific (L4) | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0.00 | No | Fail |

Rule registered as **r_003**. Re-run: **STILL FAILING** — the rule passes validation but Qwen does not reliably fire it at inference on this specific image.

**Round 2 (dialogic)**: The pupil's confusion was fed back to the expert: which rules were active, that none fired, and what the validator found when checking each precondition on the trigger image. The tutor authored a second rule targeting a different feature — the disproportionately large, domed head and stubby bill giving a "big-headed" top-heavy silhouette.

> *When a uniformly black cowbird displays a disproportionately large, domed head that is visibly wider or taller than expected for the body size, combined with a short, stubby bill that appears compressed vertically and does not taper to a fine point — identify as Bronzed Cowbird.*

Rule registered as **r_004**. Re-run: **STILL FAILING**. Both structural rules (r_003 and r_004) pass validation but the specific image remains challenging — structural gestalt features (bill depth, head proportions) appear to be insufficiently salient or ambiguous in this particular shot.

---

### Case 4 — Shiny_Cowbird_0080

![Shiny_Cowbird_0080](../assets/birds/shiny_0080_unfixed.jpg)

**Ground truth**: Shiny Cowbird
**Qwen's prediction**: Bronzed Cowbird — WRONG

**What Qwen missed**: This is a female or subdued-plumage Shiny Cowbird. The head is smoothly rounded with no ruff, the nape is flat, the bill is slim and straight, and the eye is dark. Qwen apparently saw "plain brown cowbird" and defaulted to Bronzed — the reverse of its error on the all-black birds.

**Expert's corrective rule (Round 1)**: Expert authored a Shiny Cowbird rule targeting the absence of neck ruff, flat-crowned head profile, slender bill, and dark eye. Rule fired on the trigger image but the held-out validator could not confirm those features consistently in pool images — TP=0 on 4 Shiny pool images. Rule **rejected**.

**Round 2 (dialogic)**: Expert was given the pupil's confusion context (round 1 rules active including r_003 which fired as a false positive, pupil's stated reasoning). A second rule was authored emphasizing the uniformly dull brown plumage and absence of all Bronzed structural markers. This rule also failed the held-out gate (TP=0 on pool). Rule **rejected**.

**Resolved via cross-rule anchoring**: After all four Bronzed Cowbird rules (r_001–r_004) were active, the rerun classified this image correctly — none of the Bronzed rules fired on the all-brown bird (no red iris, no black plumage, no heavy bill matching the thresholds), so Qwen correctly defaulted to Shiny Cowbird. The fix required no dedicated Shiny rule — the accumulated Bronzed knowledge implicitly defined the boundary.

## 7. Results

### Zero-shot baseline (Qwen3-VL-8B, no rules)

| Pair | Correct | Total | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bronzed Cowbird vs Shiny Cowbird | 2 | 6 | 33.3% |

### Patching loop outcomes (2 rounds)

| Failure | Round | Expert's diagnosis | Rule | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bronzed_0019 | 1 | Missed red iris + thick bill | r_001 registered (precision=1.00) | **Fixed** (r_001 fires at rerun) |
| Bronzed_0061 | 1 | Missed red iris + neck ruff | r_002 registered (precision=1.00) | **Fixed** (r_002 fires at rerun) |
| Bronzed_0081 | 1 | Missed heavy bill + bull-necked silhouette | r_003 registered (spectrum L0, precision=1.00) | STILL FAILING — rule passes validation but pupil does not fire it |
| Shiny_0080 | 1 | Missed absence of neck ruff + slim bill | Rejected — validator TP=0 on pool | STILL FAILING |
| Bronzed_0081 | 2 | Tutor re-engaged with pupil confusion context | r_004 registered (domed head + stubby bill) | STILL FAILING |
| Shiny_0080 | 2 | Tutor re-engaged; rule again rejected | Rejected — validator TP=0 on pool | **Fixed** via cross-rule anchoring |

### After patching

| Phase | Correct | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| Zero-shot (Qwen3-VL-8B) | 2/6 | 33.3% |
| After 2-round KF patching | 5/6 | 83.3% |
| Delta | +3 | **+50pp** |
| Rules authored / accepted / registered | 6 / 4 / 4 | |
| Round 1 rules | 4 authored / 3 registered | |
| Round 2 rules (dialogic) | 2 authored / 1 registered | |

### Cross-rule anchoring

The most striking result is **cross-rule anchoring** on Shiny_0080:
- No dedicated Shiny Cowbird rule ever passed validation (validator could not confirm the absence-of-ruff feature reliably in pool images).
- Yet after 4 Bronzed Cowbird rules were registered, Shiny_0080 was correctly classified — because none of the Bronzed rules fire on a brown, smooth-headed, slim-billed bird, causing the pupil to correctly default to Shiny Cowbird.

The accumulated Bronzed knowledge implicitly defined the boundary for the opposite class, without any explicit Shiny rule needed. This is the cross-class complement effect: a sufficiently rich rule set for class A can act as negative evidence for class B.

## 8. What This Shows About Dialogic Learning

### The pupil can be taught — if it is teachable

Qwen3-VL-8B followed the injected rules. When r_001 said "if you see a bright red iris, classify as Bronzed Cowbird," Qwen correctly applied that instruction when the feature was visible in a new image. This is not guaranteed for all models — some models effectively ignore injected rules, reverting to their training distribution regardless. Verifying that a candidate pupil is teachable before running the full loop is an important prerequisite.

### A single precise rule can fix multiple failures

Two rules fixed two failures each. Neither rule was authored with the second failure in mind — cross-generalization was an emergent result of capturing the right underlying field mark. This is Dialogic Learning at work: the expert's explanation of *why* the first failure was wrong turned out to contain the knowledge needed to fix a second, unrelated image.

### The precision gate protects what already works

Both rejected rules were rejected correctly. The Bronzed_0061 rule was over-tightened by the completer until it stopped firing on its own target image. The Shiny_0080 rule described genuine features but the validator could not reliably confirm them in held-out images — which means the rule would have been unreliable in deployment. The system declined to register both. This is not a bug; it is the expected behavior of a conservative validation gate.

### Expert language does not need to be technical

The accepted rules were derived from the same kind of language an experienced field ornithologist would use with a beginning student: "the eye is bright red, not dark brown," "the bill is thick-based and slightly decurved." No ML terminology. No training data. No annotation tooling. The domain expertise was sufficient on its own.

### Dialogic round 2: the loop works, but the hard case remains hard

After round 1, the pupil's expressed confusion — which rules were active, whether they fired, what the validator observed on the trigger image — was assembled into a context block and given to the tutor for round 2. The tutor authored a new rule targeting a different feature (the oversized domed head and stubby bill). The rule passed validation. But Bronzed_0081 still failed.

This shows both the value and the limit of multi-round dialogic exchange: the loop correctly identified that the round 1 rules were not firing and tasked the tutor with a different angle of attack. But if the diagnostic feature is genuinely ambiguous or low-contrast in a particular image, no amount of re-authoring can fix it at inference time. The problem shifted from "the tutor did not explain the right thing" to "the feature is not visible enough in this specific shot."

### Cross-class anchoring: you don't always need a rule for the hard class

Shiny_0080 was never fixed by a dedicated Shiny Cowbird rule — every Shiny rule failed validation. It was fixed indirectly, by the accumulation of four Bronzed Cowbird rules that together made the alternative hypothesis too costly. When none of the Bronzed rules fire on a plain brown bird, the pupil correctly defaults to Shiny. This emergent effect was not designed in. It suggests that in binary classification, building a sufficiently rich rule set for one class may implicitly resolve failures in the other.

### What this is — and what true dialogic learning would look like

The round 2 exchange is closer to dialogic learning than a single-pass injection, but it is not yet the full vision. It is more accurately described as **structured tutoring with feedback**: the system assembles the pupil's failure record into a context block and presents it to the tutor; the tutor responds with a new rule; the pupil applies it. The information flow is real, but it is one-directional within each round. The pupil does not actually formulate a question. It does not say "I can see the bill looks thick, but I'm uncertain whether it's thick *enough* — can you give me a reference?" It does not push back, express partial understanding, or identify which precondition it found ambiguous. The "pupil question" is synthesized by the system from failure data, not expressed by the pupil in its own words.

**The long-term goal is true dialogic learning** — an exchange where the pupil has a genuine first-class reasoning trace and can initiate questions, express degrees of uncertainty, and negotiate with the tutor over which features are visible or reliable in a given image. Whether that is achievable depends heavily on the pupil model's capability. A model that produces only a prediction and a one-sentence justification gives the system very little to work with. A model that can express *what it was looking for*, *what it found*, and *where its confidence broke down* gives the tutor a much richer target for correction — and opens the door to genuinely collaborative learning rather than repeated one-way instruction.

The teachability test — verifying that a candidate pupil will follow injected rules at all — is a prerequisite for any of this. But teachability alone is not enough. The next level requires a pupil that can **express its own confusion clearly enough for a tutor to respond to it**.
