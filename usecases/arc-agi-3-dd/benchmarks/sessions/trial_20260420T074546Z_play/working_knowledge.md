LESSONS_FROM_LAST_RUN (YOU wrote this at the end of your
previous play session.  It REPLACES any contradictory
claim below — trust it over the Round-2 assessment and
over any prior_knowledge):
Level ls20-9607627b: 0/7 levels completed across two full sessions (62+ turns total). Core mechanics remain poorly understood. Here is everything confirmed and suspected:

ACTIONS: ACTION1 moves the agent/cursor upward by ~5 rows (confirmed multiple times). ACTION3 moves it left by ~5 cols (confirmed). ACTION2 and ACTION4 effects remain ambiguous — they may move the cursor down/right respectively, or they may be state-mutation triggers. No visible state change on the playing field was ever observed from any action except cursor movement and progress bar decrement.

ELEMENTS: The colored block (colors 12/9, starting ~rows 44-46, cols 34-38) is the movable agent. The white cross (~rows 30-32, cols 20-22) is the change_indicator — its role is still unclear; it may be a separate cursor or a fixed marker. The top bordered box (rows 8-15, cols 32-40, color-3 border) and bottom-left bordered box (rows 53-62, cols 1-10) are reference glyphs encoding the target pattern. The yellow bar (bottom strip) is a MOVE BUDGET that decrements ~1-2 per action — it does NOT fill toward a win. Starting budget ~42 actions. Red dots bottom-right are remaining lives.

WIN CONDITION: Unknown. Hypothesis: navigate the agent to specific cells matching the reference glyph pattern, which triggers progress. Alternative hypothesis: ACTION2 or ACTION4 stamps/imprints a color at the agent's current position, and the player must imprint the correct pattern matching the reference glyph.

CRITICAL TRAPS: Both sessions were wasted on probing. With only ~42 actions total, any more than 3-4 test moves is fatal. Do not probe — commit to a strategy immediately.

RECOMMENDED NEXT ATTEMPT: Press ACTION2 once, ACTION4 once to confirm directions. Then navigate agent to the reference glyph coordinates (rows 11-13, cols 35-37) and try ACTION2/ACTION4 there to see if it stamps color. If no change, try overlapping agent with the white cross.

ELEMENTS (from your Round-2 revised assessment):
  #1 reference_glyph_top bbox=[8, 32, 15, 40] fn=target — Small bordered box (color 3 border, color 5 interior) with internal color-9 pattern. Per prior knowledge, this is a reference glyph encoding the target state the player must recreate. Never moved in any probe. The internal pattern (rows 11-13, cols 35-37) shows a specific arrangement of color-9 cells.
  #2 change_indicator bbox=[30, 20, 32, 22] fn=switch — White cross (color 0 and 1 pixels) in the main floor area. Per prior knowledge this is a change indicator marking where the next state transition will occur when an action fires. Never moved in any probe.
  #4 main_floor_area bbox=[24, 14, 50, 53] fn=wall — Large color-3 region forming the navigable playing field. Contains the agent, change indicator, and colored blocks. Has gaps (color-4 regions) within it.
  #6 agent_cursor bbox=[44, 34, 46, 38] fn=agent — The movable colored block (colors 12 and 9) that responds to ACTION1 (moves up 5 cells) and ACTION3 (moves left 5 cells). This is the player-controlled cursor/agent. Starting position approximately rows 44-46, cols 34-38 in the initial frame.
  #7 reference_glyph_bottom_left bbox=[53, 1, 62, 10] fn=target — Small bordered box in bottom-left area with internal L-shaped glyph. Per prior knowledge, this is the second reference glyph in a matched pair with element 1. Encodes a target pattern.
  #8 progress_bar bbox=[61, 13, 62, 54] fn=readout — Yellow (color 11) horizontal bar in the bottom UI strip. Acts as a progress counter that decrements by 1 per action taken (observed: 42->41 per action, 42->37 over 5 actions). Win condition likely requires filling or matching a target value.
  #9 remaining_attempts bbox=[62, 56, 63, 63] fn=counter — Red (color 8) dots/squares at far right of bottom strip. Per prior knowledge these are remaining attempts/lives. Did not change during probes (no failed episodes yet).
  #10 left_sidebar bbox=[0, 0, 51, 3] fn=decor — Consistent column of color-5 tiles on the left edge. Decorative border or UI frame. Never changed in any probe.
  #11 bottom_ui_strip bbox=[60, 12, 63, 63] fn=readout — Bottom strip containing the yellow progress bar and red attempt indicators. The yellow fill decrements with each action (counter_changes confirmed). This is the main HUD area.
  #15 gap_in_floor bbox=[29, 29, 37, 33] fn=hazard — Rectangular gap (color-4 background) within the main color-3 floor area. Could be a pit/hazard that the agent must avoid, or a passage to another section.
  #16 colored_blocks_in_floor bbox=[44, 34, 50, 38] fn=unknown — The color-12 (blue) and color-9 (orange) cells in the main floor area at rows 44-49. Some may be part of the agent's current position, others may be fixed colored tiles that form a pattern to match.

PRIMARY_GOAL: Move the agent cursor (element 6, colors 12/9) to recreate the reference glyph pattern shown in element 1 (top bordered box) on the playing field, tracked by the yellow progress bar
STRATEGY_NOTES: ACTION1 moves the agent upward (dr=-5 per press). The agent needs to navigate toward the reference glyph area or toward the change indicator. The progress bar decrements with each action so efficiency matters. Need to determine ACTION2 and ACTION4 directions, then navigate the agent to match the reference pattern. The reference glyph (element 1) shows a specific color-9 arrangement that must be recreated.
OPEN_QUESTIONS:
  - What direction does ACTION2 move the agent? (P2 showed no movement - possibly blocked or ACTION2 is not a movement action)
  - What direction does ACTION4 move the agent?
  - What is the exact target pattern to recreate - is it the glyph in element 1 or element 7?
  - Does the progress bar fill UP toward a goal or does it represent remaining moves (depleting)?
  - What happens when the agent reaches the change indicator (white cross) - does it trigger a state change?

PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE (operator-injected, treat as given):
Prior knowledge from previous plays of the ls* game family (ls20, ls21, ...).

Treat these as strong priors — learned from other levels and other ls-series
games — but still subject to per-level evidence from the grounding pack.

1. The white cross (color 0 pixel cluster in the main floor area) is NOT
   the agent.  In ls-family games it is a "change indicator": it marks the
   cell where the next state transition will happen when an action fires.

2. ACTION1..ACTION4 are NOT directional movement keys.  They are
   "state-mutation" actions: each one attempts to change a property of the
   cell under the cross (or a neighbouring cell) — for example, toggling a
   floor tile, activating a switch, or imprinting a glyph.

3. The yellow horizontal bar at the bottom of the frame is a PROGRESS
   counter.  The level win condition is to fill it completely, usually by
   making the playing-field state match a reference pattern encoded
   somewhere on the frame.

4. The three red squares at the bottom-right are REMAINING ATTEMPTS (lives).
   Each failed episode reduces them by one.

5. Small bordered boxes with an internal glyph (here: the top-centre
   bordered room and the bottom-left corner icon) are USUALLY
   "reference glyphs" — they encode the target state the player must
   recreate on the playing field.  They often appear in matched PAIRS:
   one serves as the reference, the other as a write-target.

6. A win in ls-family games typically requires recreating the reference
   glyph (item 5) on the playing field using the state-mutation actions
   (item 2), tracked by the progress bar (item 3).

These priors come from other levels — they may still be wrong for this
specific level.  If the grounding pack directly contradicts any of them,
trust the grounding pack.
