"""Cognitive engine — domain-agnostic symbolic reasoning substrate.

This package implements a generic cognitive engine that operates purely on
symbolic observations, hypotheses, goals, and plans.  It has no knowledge of
any specific domain (ARC-AGI-3, robotics, etc.) — domain-specific perception
and action translation live in Adapters (see `core.cognitive_os.engine.adapters`).

Design principle (standing directive):
    Game-specific or task-specific solutions MUST NOT be injected into this
    package.  Every capability needed to solve a particular problem must be
    expressed as a generalisation of the substrate — a new miner, a new
    claim type, a new planner heuristic — that would remain useful for an
    unrelated future domain.  The engine is a learning system: knowledge
    accumulated from one episode should benefit future episodes across the
    same and other domains.

LLM seams:
    Two typed oracle protocols allow an LLM (or any equivalent oracle) to
    be consulted at bounded, audited points in the loop:

    * OBSERVER  — visual / perceptual queries (frame + typed question →
                  typed answer).  For appearance-based questions the
                  engine cannot answer symbolically.
    * MEDIATOR  — common-sense / world-knowledge queries (symbolic
                  WorldStateSummary + typed question → structured
                  Claims/Goals/Rules, optionally including
                  ToolProposals or ToolInvocations).  Used at impasses,
                  cold starts, unexplained surprises, hazard assessment,
                  and tool-creation requests.

    Both oracles produce typed outputs; free-form text is confined to
    `explanation` fields that never enter the decision path.  Budgets
    are enforced via `LLMBudget` and tracked by the ResourceTracker.

Tool system:
    The adapter exposes domain primitives (grid BFS, symmetry detection,
    motion planning, etc.) through a generic ToolRegistry.  Miners,
    Planner, Explorer, and Mediator invoke tools by name via
    ToolInvocation; the adapter dispatches and returns ToolResults.
    Sync and async modes are both supported (signature carries
    `is_async` and `typical_latency_ms`).  Learned Options — macro-
    actions synthesised from recurring successful plan fragments — are
    added to the action space across episodes, so the system's toolkit
    grows over time.

Phase 1 (current): data types only — Observation, Hypothesis, Goal, Plan,
Rule, WorldState, the Claim/Condition/Credence machinery they reference,
and the Observer + Mediator query/answer protocols.  No behaviour beyond
canonicalisation and trivial accessors.
