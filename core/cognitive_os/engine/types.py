"""Core data types of the cognitive engine.

This module consolidates the top-level types the rest of the engine
operates on: Observation, Hypothesis, Rule, Goal, Plan, WorldState, and
the Observer query protocol.  Lower-level types (Condition, Claim,
Credence) live in their own modules and are re-exported via the package
``__init__``.

All types in this module are pure data structures.  Phase 1 contains no
behaviour beyond simple accessors and factory helpers; learning,
planning, and execution are implemented in later phases.

Standing directive: nothing in this file may encode the mechanics of
any specific domain.  ``Observation.raw_frame`` is typed as ``Any``
deliberately — adapters decide what a "frame" is (2-D image, video
segment, point cloud, ROS message).  Event types are generic
(AgentMoved, ResourceChanged, EntityStateChanged); per-domain semantics
live in the adapter that emits them.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id
        Stable identifier.

        Human-readable name (may appear in logs and Mediator contexts).
    parameters
        Ordered tuple of ``(param_name, type_hint)`` pairs describing

    internal_plan
        The concrete sub-plan with parameter placeholders.  Execution
        substitutes actual arguments at invocation time.
    applicability
        Condition under which invoking the Option is sensible.  The
        Planner uses this as a guard; invocations whose preconditions
        are not met are rejected.
    expected_effects
        Claims the Option is believed to produce on success.  Feed into
        Planner forecasting and into post-hoc evidence comparison.
    success_rate
        Empirical success rate over past invocations; updated after each
        use.  Used by the OR-node branch selector (via StrategyClaim) to
        compare competing Options.
    n_uses
        Total invocations recorded.
    source
        Provenance tag: ``"synthesiser:RepeatedFragment"`` for code-side
        synthesis, ``"mediator:synthesis"`` for Mediator-proposed options,
        ``"user:teach"`` for operator-taught macros.
    scope
        Defaults to ``ScopeKind.GAME`` — re-usable in future runs of the
        same game/task.  Promoted to ``ScopeKind.GLOBAL`` once the

# CachedSolution — recorded executable sequence for a known task
# ===========================================================================


@dataclass
class CachedSolution:
    """A recorded sequence of actions known to achieve a specific task.

    This is the substrate for two superficially different capabilities
    that are structurally the same:

    **Game-level replay (ARC-AGI-3)** — an action sequence that solved
    a specific level.  Loaded in training mode to skip past already-
    solved levels; purged in competition mode.  Typically
    ``scope = LEVEL``.

    **Procedural / muscle-memory skills (robotics)** — a rehearsed
    motor sequence for a task like "walk to pose X" or "grasp cup",
    executed efficiently with minimal cognitive monitoring.  Typically
    ``scope = GAME`` (task-family-specific) or ``GLOBAL``
    (cross-task locomotion primitives like "walk").

    Distinct from :class:`Hypothesis` because it is a *recording* or
    *rehearsed procedure*, not a probabilistic belief.  A single
    failure does not falsify a CachedSolution — especially a
    non-deterministic one — it just updates the empirical success
    rate.  Removal happens by explicit abandonment (low success rate
    dropping below a threshold, or mode-gated purging at episode
    start).

    Distinct from :class:`Option` because:

    * An Option is a first-class entry in the action space; the
      Planner composes it with other actions during search.
    * A CachedSolution is a *complete* procedure for a task and is
      typically invoked as a whole unit with reduced monitoring.
    * Options are always parameterised abstractions; CachedSolutions
      may be concrete (exact action sequence for one level) or
      parameterised (muscle-memory skills).

    Attributes
    ----------
    id
        Stable identifier, typically ``f"{task_id}:{params_hash}"``.
    task_id
        Adapter-defined task identifier.  Examples:
        ``"arc:ls20:L2"``, ``"robotics:walk_to"``,
        ``"robotics:grasp_from_table"``.  The engine does not parse
        this string; the adapter owns the naming convention.
    task_parameters
        For parameterised skills (e.g. walk-to-pose-X), the sorted
        tuple of ``(name, value)`` pairs.  Empty for concrete
        recordings.
    plan
        The action sequence.  For muscle-memory skills the sequence
        may reference parameters by name; for concrete recordings the
        sequence is literal.
    deterministic
        If True, repeated execution from the same start state yields
        the same outcome (exact replay).  If False, the environment
        is stochastic — the solution should be treated as a strong
        prior that informs planning rather than a guaranteed outcome.
        **Even ARC-AGI-3 levels may be stochastic** (timing-dependent
        mechanics); robotics is almost always stochastic.  Callers
        must not assume determinism by default.
    monitor_level
        How tightly the executor watches for deviation during replay:

        * ``"low"`` — muscle-memory mode.  Execute the sequence with
          minimal checking; only hard failure signals (life lost,
          safety violation) interrupt.  Fastest; best for well-
          rehearsed skills in predictable contexts.
        * ``"moderate"`` — check preconditions at key waypoints
          declared by the plan.  Catches mid-sequence drift while
          still running most steps without scrutiny.
        * ``"full"`` — standard planner monitoring throughout.  Each
          step's expected effects are compared to actual observations
          and divergence triggers replanning.  Slowest but safest for
          new or stochastic contexts.
    n_uses / n_successes
        Empirical usage statistics; updated by PostMortem after each
        invocation.  See :meth:`success_rate`.
    scope
        Default ``LEVEL`` for game-specific recordings; ``GAME`` or
        ``GLOBAL`` for transferable procedural skills.  Critical for
        competition-mode purging — see
        :class:`core.cognitive_os.engine.config.OperatingMode`.
    source
        Provenance tag.  Examples:
        ``"postmortem:recording"`` (captured from a successful episode),
        ``"rehearsal:training"`` (deliberately practised), or
        ``"user:teach"`` (taught by operator demonstration).

# ===========================================================================
# Oracle protocols — Observer (visual) and Mediator (common-sense)
# ===========================================================================
#
# The engine is code-centric: hypothesis formation, credence updates,
# planning, and action selection are algorithms, not LLM calls.  But two
# capabilities are genuinely hard to code and genuinely useful to hand to
# an LLM:
#
#   1. OBSERVER — visual / perceptual oracle.  Given one or more raw
#      frames and a typed question ("are these two entities still
#      similar?", "classify this object"), return a typed answer.  Used
#      by the engine to resolve appearance-based RelationalClaims and
#      to bootstrap initial visual structure at episode start.
#
#   2. MEDIATOR — common-sense / world-knowledge oracle.  Given a
#      SYMBOLIC summary of the current WorldState and a typed question
#      ("what roles do these entities likely play?", "what strategy is
#      reasonable at this impasse?"), return structured Claims, Goals,
#      or Rules the engine should consider.  Used when miner-based
#      learning is inadequate: new entity types, impasses, surprises
#      without local explanation.
#
# Both oracles share the same discipline:
#
#   * Typed inputs and typed outputs — no free-form text in the
#     decision path (free text is allowed in `explanation` fields for
#     audit/logging only).
#   * Stateless across calls — the Oracle receives whatever context it
#     needs inside the query; the engine retains no Oracle state.
#   * Budgeted via ResourceTracker — LLMBudget splits the cap between
#     Observer and Mediator so that one cannot starve the other.
#   * Outputs are treated as evidence, not commands — a Mediator-proposed
#     Claim enters the HypothesisStore with an LLM-source prior credence
#     and must still be validated by subsequent observation.  A
#     Mediator hallucination fails to accumulate support and is pruned.
#
# Adapters implement the oracles however suits their domain: a VLM for
# Observer, a text LLM for Mediator, a hand-written rules engine, or a
# human-in-the-loop operator.  The engine does not care.

    SUGGEST_STRATEGY
        Given the current impasse (plan exhausted or repeatedly failing),
        what high-level strategy is reasonable?  Output: a small number

        attempt, possibly with a suggested OR-node addition.
    WARN_HAZARDS
