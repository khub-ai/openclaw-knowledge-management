A classification model made an error on a {config.item_noun}. Your job is to author
a precise visual rule that would have led to the correct {config.classification_noun} —

The rule must be:
1. Purely visual — observable in a {config.item_noun} only (no {config.non_visual_exclusions})
2. Expressed as a pre-condition + prediction: "When [{config.feature_noun} features are met],
   classify as [{config.class_noun}]"
3. The pre-condition must be specific enough to EXCLUDE false positives — it should
   NOT apply to typical cases of the opposing {config.class_noun}
4. Generalizable: it must describe a pattern that applies to a class of similar
   {config.item_noun_plural}, not just this one image

You will be shown a {config.item_noun} and a candidate rule with its pre-conditions.

You are a {config.expert_role}.

You are given a candidate rule and evidence about where it works (TRUE POSITIVES)

the rule at different levels of specificity — from most general to most specific —
so that the tightest version that still passes a precision gate can be selected.

The four levels must all favor the same {config.class_noun} and describe the same underlying
visual phenomenon, varying only in how many pre-conditions are required:

  Level 1 — MOST GENERAL: single essential pre-condition. The one {config.feature_noun} that
    is most diagnostic of the favored {config.class_noun} and most absent from FP cases.
    This should fire broadly — accept some FP risk.

  Level 2 — MODERATE: core pre-condition PLUS one supporting condition that
    begins to exclude FP cases.

  Level 3 — SPECIFIC: the original expert rule as-is (copy it unchanged).

  Level 4 — MOST SPECIFIC: the original rule PLUS one additional pre-condition
    derived from the contrastive analysis that should eliminate the observed FPs.

def rule_completer_system(config: DomainConfig) -> str:
    return f"""\
You are a {config.expert_role} completing a classification rule.

BACKGROUND
The rule was authored by an expert responding to a specific misclassification. Experts
naturally write DIAGNOSTIC rules: they describe what was distinctive about that one
{config.item_noun}. But they omit BACKGROUND conditions — {config.feature_noun}s so obvious to
a trained expert that they go without saying. When the rule is evaluated by a naive
classifier that checks only what is explicitly listed, those omitted conditions create
loopholes: the rule fires on {config.item_noun_plural} that share the distinctive feature but
lack the expected background markers of the favored {config.class_noun}.

YOUR TASK
Identify the implicit pre-conditions the expert assumed but did not write down.
These are conditions that:
  1. Are standard, well-established {config.feature_noun}s expected to be PRESENT for
     the favored {config.class_noun} (positive background conditions).
  2. Are standard markers expected to be ABSENT for the favored {config.class_noun} — i.e.,
     features that would instead indicate the confusable {config.class_noun} — that the rule
     does not already exclude (negative background conditions).
  3. Are NOT already covered, even implicitly, by the existing pre-conditions.

DO NOT add:
  - Conditions that could plausibly occur in both {config.class_noun}es.
  - Conditions already implied by the existing pre-conditions.
  - Highly specific conditions that would rarely be met — do not over-tighten.
  - Non-visual conditions ({config.non_visual_exclusions}) unless clearly visible.

Keep the original rule text and feature key unchanged.
Add the new pre-conditions to the existing list.

Output ONLY a JSON object (no markdown fences, no commentary outside the JSON):
{{
  "rule": "<original rule text — unchanged>",
  "feature": "<original feature key — unchanged>",
  "favors": "<unchanged>",
  "confidence": "<unchanged>",

                           implicit and why it needed to be made explicit>"
}}

to add, return the rule unchanged with "added_preconditions": [] and explain why.

You are a {config.expert_role} reviewing a proposed classification rule before
it is tested on {config.item_noun_plural}.

You will be given:
1. A candidate rule and its pre-conditions
2. The pair of {config.class_noun}es it is meant to distinguish (favored vs confusable)

Your task: evaluate whether each pre-condition is a reliable visual discriminator.

For each pre-condition, rate it as one of:
- "reliable"          — {config.feature_noun} consistently separates the favored {config.class_noun}
                        from the confusable one; rarely or never present in the other
- "unreliable"        — feature can easily occur in both {config.class_noun}es, is too vague,
                        or points in the wrong direction
- "context_dependent" — only discriminating under specific co-occurring conditions;
                        risky as a stand-alone gate

Then give an overall recommendation:
- "accept"  — all or most pre-conditions are reliable; safe to proceed to image validation
- "revise"  — one or more pre-conditions are unreliable; flag them before image validation
- "reject"  — the rule's core logic is fundamentally flawed; do not spend image-validation
