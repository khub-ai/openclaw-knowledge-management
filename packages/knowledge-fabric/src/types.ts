 *   effectiveConfidence = max(floor, floor + (confidence − floor) × decayFactor)
 *
 * Design rationale:
 *   - candidate/accumulating artifacts have no floor: unconfirmed observations
 *     should expire naturally if the user never reinforces them.
 *   - consolidated artifacts decay toward a floor, not zero: validated knowledge
 *     doesn't disappear, it shifts from [established] toward [suggestion].
 *   - high-validation artifacts have longer half-lives and higher floors:
 *     knowledge confirmed many times resists decay appropriately.
 *   - salience further modulates the floor: safety-critical knowledge decays
 *     more slowly regardless of validation count.
