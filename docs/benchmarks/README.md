# Benchmarks and Walkthroughs

This directory contains the specification and instructional documentation for every runnable test program and benchmark in the PIL project.

---

## Purposes

These documents serve three distinct purposes, and every benchmark should be designed with all three in mind.

### 1. Inspection by interested parties

A reader — whether a potential adopter, a researcher, or a technical evaluator — should be able to open any benchmark document and understand:

- What specific question about the system this benchmark answers
- What the system must do correctly for the benchmark to pass
- What failure would mean for the system's practical usefulness
- Whether the design choices reflected in the benchmark represent a sound direction

Benchmarks are not just test harnesses. They are also a form of argument: "here is what we believe the system should do, here is how we verify it, and here is why it matters."

### 2. Developer communication

Benchmarks are the primary medium through which developers (human or AI) agree on what the system is supposed to do. Each document captures:

- The precise specification of a pipeline stage's correct behavior
- The test cases that define the boundary between passing and failing
- What is currently implemented, what is pending, and what is deliberately deferred
- Which module owns the behavior being tested
- Open questions about the design that are not yet resolved

When two developers disagree about whether a behavior is correct, the benchmark document should be the reference. When a developer proposes changing the system's behavior, the benchmark document is what must be updated first.

### 3. Foundation for automated self-evaluation

Every test case specified here is a candidate for inclusion in an automated evaluation pipeline. The goal is that over time:

- All benchmark cases have corresponding automated tests (unit, integration, or LLM-evaluated)
- Metrics are defined precisely enough that they can be computed without human judgment
- The evaluation pipeline can be run against any candidate system change to detect regressions
- Eventually, the evaluation results can be fed back into the system itself as training signal for self-improvement

Documents mark which cases are already automated, which are partially automated, and which require LLM-evaluation or human judgment.

## How to run automated benchmarks

The automated unit tests (mock LLMs, no API key required):

```bash
pnpm --filter @khub-ai/computer-assistant test
```

The live LLM benchmarks (Anthropic API key required, ~2–5 minutes):

```bash
cd apps/computer-assistant
pnpm benchmark
```

The playground end-to-end walkthrough (API key required, ~15–30 seconds):

```bash
cd apps/playground
pnpm start
```

To run against a clean store without affecting the shared artifact file:

```bash
KNOWLEDGE_STORE_PATH=/tmp/pil-bench.jsonl pnpm benchmark
```

## Conventions used in benchmark documents

### Test case format

Each test case has:
- **ID** — unique identifier, e.g. `EX-3` (extraction, case 3)
- **Input** — the exact message or state the system receives
- **Expected output** — what the system must produce
- **Pass criterion** — the precise condition that determines pass or fail
- **Automated coverage** — whether a corresponding unit test exists

### Coverage notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Full | All meaningful sub-cases are covered |
| ⚠️ Partial | Some sub-cases are covered; gaps are listed explicitly |
| 🔲 Placeholder | Specification written; no implementation or test yet |
| ❌ Not covered | Known gap; reason documented |

### Automated vs. human-evaluated

Some test cases can be verified programmatically (exact output match, type check, threshold comparison). Others require LLM evaluation (is this consolidation output a good generalization?) or human judgment. The distinction is marked per case.
