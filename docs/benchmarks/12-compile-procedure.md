# Benchmark 12: Compile Procedure — Recipe → Executable Program Escalation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Scenario** | Procedure artifact compiled into a runnable script |
| **What it tests** | `compileToProgram()` code generation · disk persistence · `[EXECUTABLE:]` context hint · in-place re-compile |
| **Automated test** | `apps/computer-assistant/src/tests/bench-compile-procedure.test.ts` |
| **Run with** | `pnpm test` |

## Scenario

After a procedure artifact has been learned over several sessions, the agent can escalate it
from a natural-language recipe into a runnable program. This benchmark validates the full
lifecycle described in `docs/example-learning-in-action.md` Session 4:

> *"I've now run this procedure three months in a row and the steps are identical each time.
> Want me to turn it into a script?"*
> → Agent generates a Python script, attaches it to the procedure artifact,
> and on the next relevant request uses `run-command` instead of manual steps.

---

## Why this is interesting

### Problem 1 — Keeping the recipe alongside the program

When a procedure is compiled, the natural-language recipe (`content`) is always retained as
primary documentation and manual fallback. Only the `program` field is added via `revise()`.
The agent should **never replace** the readable recipe with the script — both coexist.

This matters because:
- The script may not run on a new machine without installing dependencies
- The user may want to inspect or modify the steps before automating them
- A future `revise()` of the procedure must still start from the recipe text, not code
- The recipe serves as the **authoritative specification for post-execution verification**:
  after the script runs, the agent (or the user) can compare actual outcomes against the
  recipe's expected steps to confirm the procedure succeeded. This is the governance role
  of the natural-language form — it is the source of truth that the compiled program is
  supposed to implement, making the overall system significantly more robust against silent
  script failures or partial execution

### Problem 2 — In-place update, not retire-and-create

`compileToProgram()` calls `revise(procedure, { program: {...} })`. Because only the `program`
field changes (the recipe `content` is identical), Jaccard similarity = 1.0 >> 0.5 threshold.
`revise()` updates the artifact in place: same `id`, `revisedAt` set, store count unchanged.

If this were naïvely treated as a content change, each compile would retire the old artifact
and create a fresh one — accumulating orphan artifacts and breaking retrieval continuity.

### Problem 3 — Context hint for the agent LLM

After compilation, the agent must know a script exists so it can choose `run-command` over
manual steps on subsequent requests. This is done via `formatArtifactsForPrompt()`, which
appends `[EXECUTABLE: /path/to/script]` to any procedure artifact whose `program.path` is set.

The agent system prompt instructs:
> *"When PIL context includes a procedure line ending with `[EXECUTABLE: /path/to/script]`,
> prefer `run-command python /path/to/script` for execution requests."*

### Problem 4 — Re-compiling doesn't create a second program

When the user asks to regenerate the script (e.g., after revising the procedure), calling
`compileToProgram()` again must overwrite the previous `program` block in-place, not produce
a second artifact. The store must remain at the same artifact count after both compiles.

## Conversation trace

| Session | Turn | Input | PIL / agent events |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | User | Download January Chase statement, rename `2026-01-chase-checking.pdf`, put in Finance/Statements | — |
|   | Agent | Done. Saved to `~/Finance/Statements/2026-01-chase-checking.pdf`. | *(none — one-off task)* |
| 2 | User | Download February Chase statement. Same as last time. | — |
|   | Agent | Renamed to `2026-02-chase-checking.pdf` and saved. Naming pattern: YYYY-MM-institution-account.pdf. Want me to remember? | — |
|   | User | Yes, always use that pattern. | **convention created** |
| 3 | User | Get my February Fidelity statement too. | — |
|   | Agent | Saved. You now have two institutions. Want a monthly checklist? | — |
|   | User | Good idea. Add Amex too — I always forget that one. | **fact created** (Chase, Fidelity, Amex); **procedure created** (monthly download checklist) |
| 4 | User | Create a Python script to automate monthly statement downloads. | — |
|   | Agent | *(action: compile-procedure, target: python)* | **procedure revised in-place**: `program.code`, `program.path`, `program.generatedAt` set |
|   | Agent | Script saved to `~/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py`. | — |
| 5 | User | It's March — time for statements. | PIL context includes `[EXECUTABLE: ~/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py]` |

## What the code does, step by step

### `compileToProgram(procedure, relatedArtifacts, language, llm, saveDir)`

Located in `packages/knowledge-fabric/src/pipeline.ts`.

1. **Build prompt** — `buildCodeGenPrompt()` formats the procedure recipe and all supporting
   artifacts (conventions, facts) into a code-generation prompt. The phrase
   `"PROCEDURE TO AUTOMATE"` uniquely identifies this prompt (used by the mock LLM to
   distinguish it from extraction/consolidation prompts).

2. **Call LLM** — the response is raw source code (no JSON wrapper, no markdown fences).

3. **Write to disk** — if `saveDir` is provided, `mkdir -p` the directory and write the code
   to `<saveDir>/<derived-filename>.<ext>`. The filename is derived from the procedure's tags
   (e.g. tags `["monthly-statements", "download-procedure"]` → `monthly-statements-download-procedure.py`).

4. **Revise in place** — `revise(procedure, { program: { language, code, path, generatedAt } })`
   updates only the `program` field; recipe `content` is untouched; artifact `id` is preserved.

### Agent interception (`runAgentTurn` in `agent.ts`)

`compile-procedure` is intercepted in `runAgentTurn` before `executeAction()` because it needs
two things unavailable in the stateless `executeAction` function: the PIL artifact store
(to find the highest-confidence injectable procedure) and the `pilLlm` adapter (for code
generation). `executeAction` contains a safety-net error case that should never be reached.

## Test phases

| Phase | Test cases | Key assertions |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — Code generation and attachment | 5 | `program.language === "python"`; `program.code` matches mock; `program.path` ends `.py`; file exists on disk; recipe `content` unchanged |
| **Phase 2** — Persistence round-trip | 2 | `program.path` and `program.code` survive `loadAll()`; store stays at **3** active artifacts (in-place update) |
| **Phase 3** — EXECUTABLE hint | 2 | `formatArtifactsForPrompt()` includes `[EXECUTABLE: /path]` for compiled procedure; absent for uncompiled procedure |
| **Phase 4** — Re-compile in place | 2 | Second compile: same artifact `id`; store still **3** active artifacts |

**Total: 11 tests.** All run in < 1 s (no API calls; mock LLM).

---

## Running the automated test

No API key is needed. The mock LLM (`createCompileBenchmarkLLM()` in `mock-llm.ts`) handles
all three prompt types: extraction for sessions 1–3, and code-generation for the compile call.

```bash
# From the monorepo root
pnpm test

# Only this benchmark (faster feedback loop)
pnpm --filter @khub-ai/computer-assistant test -- --reporter=verbose bench-compile-procedure

# Watch mode (re-runs on file save)
pnpm --filter @khub-ai/computer-assistant test -- --watch bench-compile-procedure
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 1 — code generation and attachment > compileToProgram attaches a program block to the procedure artifact
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 1 — code generation and attachment > generates code matching the mock LLM response
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 1 — code generation and attachment > saves the script to disk and sets program.path
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 1 — code generation and attachment > file on disk contains the generated code
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 1 — code generation and attachment > procedure content (recipe) is preserved unchanged
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 2 — persistence > program field is present after loadAll()
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 2 — persistence > store still has exactly 3 active artifacts after compiling (in-place update)
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 3 — EXECUTABLE hint in agent context > includes [EXECUTABLE: path] for a procedure with a saved program
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 3 — EXECUTABLE hint in agent context > does NOT include [EXECUTABLE:] for a procedure without a compiled program
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 4 — re-compile updates in place > second compile overwrites program.code, not creates a new artifact
✓ Benchmark compile/Phase 4 — re-compile updates in place > store still has exactly 3 active artifacts after re-compiling

Tests  11 passed (11)

## Manual walkthrough (live LLM)

This walkthrough uses the `computer-assistant` REPL with a real Anthropic API key.
It produces an actual Python file in `~/.openclaw/programs/`.

### Prerequisites

```bash
node --version     # must be ≥ 18
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # must be set (sk-ant-...)
```

### Step 1 — Start the agent

```bash
cd C:/_backup/openclaw/khub-knowledge-fabric   # Windows path; adjust for your OS
pnpm --filter @khub-ai/computer-assistant start
```

You will see a `>` prompt.

### Step 2 — Session 1: one-off download (no learning)

Type this at the `>` prompt:

```
Download my January statement from Chase, rename it "2026-01-chase-checking.pdf", and put it in my Finance/Statements folder.
```

Expected: agent responds with a `say` or `run-command` action. **No `[PIL learned:]` line**
should appear — a single one-off task must not create a convention.

### Step 3 — Session 2: confirm the naming pattern

```
Download my February statement from Chase. Same as last time.
```

Agent may notice the pattern. Then:

```
Yes, always use that pattern for all financial statement filenames.
```

Expected: `[PIL learned: 1 new (convention)]` appears.

### Step 4 — Session 3: add institution list and procedure

```
Get my February statement from Fidelity too.
```

```
Good idea. Add Amex too — I always forget that one. Create a monthly checklist.
```

Expected: `[PIL learned: 2 new (fact, procedure)]` — both artifacts created in one turn.

### Step 5 — Verify the store

```
/list
```

Expected: three active artifacts — a `convention`, a `fact`, and a `procedure` (no `[EXECUTABLE:]`
in the context line yet because nothing has been compiled).

### Step 6 — Compile the procedure

```
Create a Python script to automate my monthly statement downloads.
```

Expected output includes:
```
[Action: compile-procedure → python]
Script saved to /home/<user>/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py
```

Verify the file was created:

```bash
# In a separate terminal (not the agent REPL)
cat ~/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py
```

You should see a complete, runnable Python script with `INSTITUTIONS` list, `download_statement()`,
and `main()`.

### Step 7 — Check the EXECUTABLE hint

Back in the agent REPL:

```
/list
```

The procedure line should now end with:
```
[EXECUTABLE: /home/<user>/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py]
```

### Step 8 — Trigger announce-then-run

```
It's March 2nd — time for my monthly statements.
```

Expected:
```
[Action: run-command → python /home/<user>/.openclaw/programs/monthly-statements-download-procedure.py]
Found a script for this — running it now.
```

The script will run (and fail gracefully with `TODO` stubs for the actual site-specific
download logic — credentials and selectors are left for the user to fill in).

### Step 9 — Re-compile after a procedure revision (optional)

Change the institution list (e.g., Amex closed, Schwab opened):

```
I closed my Amex account and opened a Schwab brokerage account.
```

Then ask to update the script:

```
Please update the Python script to reflect the new institution list.
```

Expected: `compileToProgram()` runs again; the store still has **3** active artifacts
(same IDs, `revisedAt` updated on the procedure; new script file on disk).

## Does this affect the official OpenClaw plugin?

**No breaking changes.** The OpenClaw plugin surface is limited to `index.ts` and `tools.ts`,
which expose a single `knowledge_search` tool. That tool calls `retrieve()` and returns
`JSON.stringify(artifacts)` — it is entirely unaware of the `program?` field.

The only observable difference in OpenClaw: if a procedure artifact has been compiled,
`knowledge_search` will now return a `program` block in the JSON alongside `content`.
The LLM agent receiving the tool result will see the script path and code, which is
informative rather than harmful. A future improvement could strip `program.code` from
the tool result (keeping `program.path` for reference) to avoid verbosity.

| Component | Changed? | Breaking? |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/knowledge-fabric/src/types.ts` | ✅ Yes — `program?` field added | ❌ No — optional field; old artifacts remain valid |
| `packages/knowledge-fabric/src/pipeline.ts` | ✅ Yes — `compileToProgram()` added | ❌ No — additive export; existing functions unchanged |
| `packages/knowledge-fabric/src/store.ts` | ❌ No changes | — |
| `packages/knowledge-fabric/src/tools.ts` | ❌ No changes | — |
| `packages/knowledge-fabric/index.ts` | ❌ No changes | — |
| `apps/computer-assistant/src/agent.ts` | ✅ Yes — `compile-procedure` handler, EXECUTABLE hint | ❌ No — app-local changes only; not part of plugin |
| `apps/computer-assistant/src/actions.ts` | ✅ Yes — new ActionKind | ❌ No — app-local |
| `apps/computer-assistant/src/llm.ts` | ✅ Yes — updated system prompt | ❌ No — app-local |

**Store format compatibility:** The JSONL store is append-only and additive. Existing artifact
lines do not have a `program` field; new compiled artifacts do. Both are valid JSON and
loadable by the current `loadAll()` parser (unknown fields are ignored by the type system
at runtime; TypeScript's optional `?` marks the field absent, not invalid).
